# Brand Identity Timeline
For a project in CSUMB's History of Communication Design course, I was tasked with creating a timeline for something related to design. An additional, but optional challenge for the assignment was to make it interactive in some way. At the time, I was also enrolled in a Graphic Identity course, so my idea was to pick some recognizable brands that were founded in the United States and create a timeline of when they adopted a visual identity that we still recognize to this day.

I created a presentational website to include an interactive element instead of creating slides. As the presenter scrolls down the page, a line is drawn in the shape of the company of interest using a SVG.
